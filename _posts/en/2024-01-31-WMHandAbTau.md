## Keys

* The relationship between WMH and amyloid beta accumulation remains unclear: From whether they are related to each other to how they are related if they are related.

* A growing number of studies are attempting to elucidate the relationship between WMH and Ab.

* There is no relationship between WMH and tau accumulation.

**Abstract**

… Finally, the regions where β-amyloid and WMH count were most positively associated were <span style="background-color:#fff5b1">the middle temporal region in the right hemisphere</span> (r = 0.18, p = 0.002) and <span style="background-color:#fff5b1">the fusiform region in the left hemisphere</span> (r = 0.017, p = 0.005). β-amyloid and WMH have a clear association, though the mechanism facilitating this association is still not fully understood. The associations found between β-amyloid and WMH burden emphasize the relationship between β-amyloid and vascular lesion formation while factors like CVRFs, age, and sex affect AD development through various mechanisms

**Data**

The subset of ADNI-3 participants who had all the T1-weighted, 3D FLAIR, Amyloid, and Tau PET modalities available

**Snippets**

- The percentage of white matter volume occupied by WMH was significantly and positively correlated with β-amyloid PET SUVR (Fig. 1; r = 0.28, p < 0.001). We observed <span style="background-color:#fff5b1">WMH volume to significantly predict global amyloid accumulation when controlling for age, sex, years of education, and scanner manufacturer</span> (F(1, 309) = 13.9, p = 0.0002).
- The correlational analyses were repeated after the log transformation of WMH volume and outcomes remained the same, resulting in <span style="background-color:#fff5b1">a significant positive correlation between WMH volume and β-amyloid</span> (r = 0.24, p = 4.9e-5), and <span style="background-color:#FFE6E6">a nonsignificant positive correlation between WMH volume and meta-temporal tau</span> (r = 0.09, p = 0.12).
- The inclusion of MOCA, MMSE, and Global CDR, as covariates, did not change the significant relationship between WMH volume and β-amyloid. We observed <span style="background-color:#fff5b1">a significant effect of hippocampal volume fraction on WMH volume</span> (F(1, 580) = 16.9, p = 4.5e-5) and β-amyloid (F(1, 309) = 32.5, p = 2.8e-8).
- WMH volume percent of participants with either amyloid (A+) or tau (T+) pathology was higher than controls (A-/T-) (Fig. 2). We observed <span style="background-color:#fff5b1">a significantly higher WMH percent in AD pathology participants (A+/T+) compared to controls (A-/T-)</span> (p = 0.007, Cohen’s d = 0.4, t = -2.5). … <span style="background-color:#fff5b1">No significant association was found in the A-/T- group</span> (r = 0.06, p = 0.45). A significant positive correlation was observed between β-amyloid SUVR and WMH count in the A+/T+ group only.
- WMH count was used as another method of measuring WMH burden. ... Both statistical tests on <span style="background-color:#fff5b1">the WMH volume and the WMH count showed similar results, confirming that WMH count is an accurate measure to use alongside WMH volume.</span> Correlations of WMH count with β-amyloid within A/T pathological groups also paralleled the WMH volume analysis result.
- Our regional analysis showed that β-amyloid and WMH accumulation in <span style="background-color:#fff5b1">the precentral, cuneus, fusiform, isthmus cingulate, lateral occipital, lingual, superior parietal, and supramarginal regions were most significantly associated across all pathological groups when averaged across hemispheres.</span> Variations in the locations of increased WMHs are indicative of AD and its phase of progression, some of these regions being more implicated in cognitive decline than others.
- We observed <span style="background-color:#FFE6E6">neither a correlation nor an association between WMH and Tau uptake in the entire cohort</span> (Fig. 4: correlation p = 0.25; association p = 0.4, controlling for age, sex, years of education, and scanner manufacturer).

- Additionally, <span style="background-color:#E6E6FF">WMH volume was only predicted by CN and MCI diagnoses, not AD.</span> The relationship between WMH volume often predicts AD in the preclinical stages, likely accounting for the relationship we observed.

- <span style="background-color:#E6F2FF">The inclusion of cognitive scores MMSE, MOCA, and Global CDR had no effect on the associations found between β-amyloid and WMH volume</span>, therefore not significantly impacting this relationship. In the literature, <span style="background-color:#E6F2FF">worse performance on these cognitive tests has been associated with increased WMH volume</span> (Wang et al., 2020).

- The relationship between higher MMSE scores and increased WMH volume showed significance with multiple comparison corrections while controlling for age and sex in the isthmus cingulate region

- For Global CDR scores, this spatial distribution was significant in the isthmus cingulate, temporal pole, and pars triangularis

- Lastly, the MOCA scores showed significant positive spatial relationships in the isthmus cingulate, linguistic, and temporal pole regions

- We also did not observe any significant effect of APOE-ε4 presence on the established relationship between β-amyloid and WMH volume or WMH count. ... Although, we did have a small sample size of individuals with the homozygous APOE-ε4 genotype.

*White matter hyperintensities: relationship to amyloid and tau burden (2019)* 

**Abstract**

<span style="background-color:#fff5b1">White matter hyperintense volumes in the detected topographic pattern correlated strongly with lobar cerebral microbleeds</span> (P < 0.001, age and sex-adjusted Cohen’s d = 0.703). In contrast, <span style="background-color:#FFE6E6">there were no white matter hyperintense regions significantly associated with increased tau burden</span> using voxel-based analysis or region-specific analysis, among non-demented elderly, amyloid load correlated with a topographic pattern of white matter hyperintensities. Further, <span style="background-color:#fff5b1">the amyloid-associated, white matter hyperintense regions strongly correlated with lobar cerebral microbleeds suggesting that cerebral amyloid angiopathy contributes to the relationship between amyloid and white matter hyperintensities.</span>

**Data**

<p align="center"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/8lRtc_4VpROGK82z1LNG6_csgW2j70aFK-1z6EtUHavsTxGrkjAOzyxf_l_6ZNFMVsEWDE2WBBkDnYTC8eSIGRPwtYTdmvVaMSYl-XidCzDWZu1aouniUOTX3hUtN76xS_ESzJ5gW6Hg0eZ9Lv0jo-U" alt="img" style="zoom: 60%;" /></p>

- Participants, aged 50 to 89, were enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA), a population-based study of Olmsted County, Minnesota residents.
- 434 non-demented participants with FLAIR-MRI, tau-PET (AV-1451), and Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET (amyloid) scans to assess the relationship between FLAIR WMH and Alzheimer’s disease pathologies.

**Snippets**

- In the study of non-demented individuals, we found that amyloid burden measured by PET was associated with a topographic pattern of WMH. <span style="background-color:#fff5b1">These amyloid-related WMH regions were associated with lobar CMBs suggesting that regional changes correlate with CAA.</span> We found <span style="background-color:#FFE6E6">no evidence to support an association between tau burden and WMH burden.</span>

* We did not detect an association between tau burden and WMH in either the voxel-level analyses or region-level analyses.

*Cognitive Profile of Amyloid Burden and White Matter Hyperintensities in Cognitively Normal Older Adults (2012)* 

**Abstract**

<span style="background-color:#fff5b1">Amyloid burden and WMH were not correlated with one another.</span> <span style="background-color:#E6F2FF">Age was associated with lower performance in all cognitive domains</span>, while <span style="background-color:#E6F2FF">higher estimated verbal intelligence was associated with higher performance in all domains.</span> Hypothesis-driven tests revealed that <span style="background-color:#fff5b1">amyloid burden and WMH had distinct cognitive profiles</span>, with <span style="background-color:#fff5b1">amyloid burden having a specific influence on episodic memory</span> and <span style="background-color:#fff5b1">WMH primarily associated with executive function but having broad (but lesser) effects on the other domains.</span> These findings suggest that even before clinical impairment, amyloid burden, and WMH likely represent neuropathological cascades with distinct etiologies and dissociable influences on cognition.

**Data**

* 168 (95 female) cognitively normal, community-dwelling older adults (aged 65–86, M=73.24, SD=5.80). 

* Participants in the Harvard Aging Brain Study, an ongoing longitudinal study currently in the baseline assessment phase

* Because of the staged nature of the visits (all baseline visits must be completed within 6 months), positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) estimates of WMH were currently available for 109 of the older adults.
